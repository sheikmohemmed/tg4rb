# TestGen4Ruby #

## Summary ##

[TestGen4Web](http://developer.spikesource.com/wiki/index.php?title=Projects:TestGen4Web) is a Firefox extension that records user actions on Firefox and generates XML code describing such actions.

TestGen4Ruby (tg4rb) translates the XML output from TestGen4Web into [Firewatir](http://code.google.com/p/firewatir/) code.

FireWatir then runs this code and replays the actions recorded by TestGen4Web.
