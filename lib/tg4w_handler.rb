  # - tg4w's xpaths start with '*/', assuming recursive search,
  # but that's not standard XPath. So we need to replace '*'
  # by 'descendant::*'.
  # - in firewatir, the generated xpath is embedded inside a pair
  # of double-quotes, so we have to escape them here.
  # - indexing is global in tg4w (FORM[3] means third form *in the
  # whole document*) and in standard XPath it's local (FORM[3] means
  # third form inside FORM[3]'s parent). our solution for now is to
  # get rid of indexes altogether. FIXME either fix upstream tg4w or
  # find a way to translate indexes properly.
  # - tg4w includes newline characters inside the xpath, so we have
  # to replace them by spaces (i don't know if that's enough) FIXME
  # returns the fixed xpath
